    <h2>Understanding Marks Percentage: A Comprehensive Guide for Students</h2>
    
    <p>Calculating your marks percentage is a fundamental skill every student needs to master. Whether you're preparing for exams, evaluating your performance, or applying for higher education, understanding how to convert your raw marks into percentages is essential. This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about marks percentages.</p>
    
    <h3>What is a Marks Percentage?</h3>
    <p>A marks percentage represents your academic performance as a proportion of the total possible marks. It standardizes your scores across different subjects or exams that may have varying total marks, allowing for easy comparison and evaluation.</p>
    
    <h3>Why Percentage Calculation Matters</h3>
    <p>Percentage calculations are crucial for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Academic Evaluation:</strong> Schools and colleges use percentages to assess student performance</li>
        <li><strong>College Admissions:</strong> Many institutions have percentage cutoffs for admission</li>
        <li><strong>Scholarships:</strong> Eligibility often depends on maintaining certain percentages</li>
        <li><strong>Self-Assessment:</strong> Helps you track your progress and set improvement goals</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>The Standard Percentage Formula</h3>
    <p>The universal formula for calculating percentage is:</p>
    <p class="formula">(Obtained Marks ÷ Total Marks) × 100 = Percentage</p>
    
    <h3>Practical Examples</h3>
    <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> If you score 85 out of 100 in a test:<br>
    (85 ÷ 100) × 100 = 85%</p>
    
    <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> For 375 marks out of 500 in an exam:<br>
    (375 ÷ 500) × 100 = 75%</p>
    
    <h3>Common Grading Systems</h3>
    <p>Most educational institutions follow similar grading scales:</p>
